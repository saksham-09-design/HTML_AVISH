                <div class="t1">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving technology that enables machines to simulate human intelligence and perform tasks such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making. It is widely used in various fields, including healthcare, finance, education, and entertainment, revolutionizing the way we interact with technology. AI-powered systems, like chatbots, virtual assistants, and self-driving cars, enhance efficiency and accuracy while reducing human effort. Machine learning and deep learning, subsets of AI, allow computers to improve their performance over time by analyzing vast amounts of data. Despite its immense potential, AI also raises ethical concerns regarding privacy, bias, and job displacement, making it crucial to develop responsible and transparent AI systems.</div>
